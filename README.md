A study guide for course pre-work
# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description


This is a study guide for boot camp students. It provides a brief overview of information on HTML, CSS, git, and JavaScript. The build for this project is to get a better understanding of skills in these topics. It has taught me to use many different functions, keys and html coding to complete a project. 


## Installation

You would need to make sure you have your SSH key assigned so that you can update your repositories. You would also need Google chrome, gitbash, and VSC in order to complete all builds correctly. 

## Usage

To use this Study Guide, open up Chrome DevTools by pressing Control+Shift+I to go through each section of notes for a specific topic. In each topic, it contains information on what I have learned throughout the prework course.
